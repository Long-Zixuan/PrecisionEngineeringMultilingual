## Key Features

- Adds angle and distance measurements when building roads, train lines, pipes and power lines.
- Hold CTRL to enable snapping to angles (in 5 degree increments).
- Hold SHIFT to enable additional information display.
- Hold ALT to enable snapping to guidelines.
- Display height of the road you are placing relative to ground level
- Display height difference between start and end point of a road (when placing, holding SHIFT)
